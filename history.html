    <h1>The History of FC Barcelona</h1>
    <p>
      Futbol Club Barcelona, more commonly known as Barça or Blaugrana, is a
      professional football (or soccer for those in the United States) club
      based out of Barcelona, Spain, that competes in the top division in
      Spanish football, La Liga. The club was founded on November 29, 1899 by a
      group of English, German, Swiss, and Catalan footballers led by Joan
      Gamper, a Swiss-born footballer who captained the club from 1899 to 1903
      as well. FC Barcelona has become so engrained into the culture of
      Catalonia that club's motto is "Més que un club," or more than a club.
      Additionally, unlike many other football clubs, FC Barcelona is owned and
      operated by its supporters, and currently, the club is the fourth most
      valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion.

      Throughout their existence, FC Barcelona has won a record 75 domestic
      trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 13 Copa de España, and other
      smaller domestic competitions. Internationally, the club has won 22
      titles, with the most notable ones being the UEFA Champions League and
      UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, in which FC Barcelona has won five and four times,
      respectively.

      and Marc-André ter Stegen. Furthermore, the club is currently managed by
      Xavi, a historical former player of the club, and the current president is
      Joan Laporta. FC Barcelona plays at Spotify Camp Nou, the fourth largest
      football stadium in the world with a capacity of 99,354 seats.
