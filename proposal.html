    <h4>What is your website about?</h4>
    <p>
      My website is going to be a fan page on my favorite soccer/football team
      in the world, FC Barcelona. This website will allow people to get all of
      the latest news on the team and learn about the team's past and current
      history.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>What is the objective of you website?</h4>
    <p>
      Though FC Barcelona are already a very well-known club in the world, I
      have found that soccer/football in general, is still not as popular in the
      United States as the rest of the world. Therefore, my objective with this
      website is to spread awareness of the club and share with people in the
      United States a little bit about FC Barcelona's history and greatness.
    </p>

    <h4>Who is your target audience?</h4>
    <p>
      My target audience is mainly soccer/football fans, FC Barcelona fans in
      particular. Since I plan on updating the website with news/updates, it
      would be very easy for a fan to go through the website and see all of the
      latest news on FC Barcelona.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h4>
    <p>
      Since the website has to have at least five pages of content, I am
      planning on including pages on the club's history, highlights,
      news/updates, scores/statistics, and current players. The history page
      will discuss the club's history since its inception and go over some of
      the club's best achievements. The highlights page will include videos of
      some of the team's best goals and plays. As for news/updates, I will be
      updating that page constantly as more news on the team comes out. For the
      scores/statistics page, I plan to include the team's schedule for the
      season and all of the scores of the games they have played. Additionally I
      will be keeping a statistics table that keeps track of the best performing
      players on the team based off certain metrics (goals/assists/chances
      created/tackles/etc.). Finally, for the current players page, I would like
      to give a brief introduction on the team's current first team players so
      that everyone vising the site is able to learn a little bit more about the
      team's players.
